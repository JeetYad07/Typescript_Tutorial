/**
 * Typescript is a syntatic superset of Javascript which adds static typing
 * This basically means that TS adds syntax on top of JS, allowing developers to add types.

 */

/**
 * Why should i use TS?
 * JS is a loosely typed language. It can be difficult to understand what types of data
 * are being passed around in JS.
 */

/**
 * Note: TypeScript uses compile time type checking. Which means it checks if the specified types
 *  match before running the code, not while running the code.

/**
 * TS compiler: TS is transpiled into JS using a compiler.

// let number = 23;
// number = "Heet" // type checking 
let username; // type has any
username = 'Jeet'
username = 234
